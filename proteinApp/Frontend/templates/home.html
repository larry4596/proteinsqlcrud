    <h1>Protein Property Analysis System</h1>

    <p>
      Proteins are biological molecules made up of amino acids. The sequence of
      amino acids determines a protein’s structure and function. Understanding
      protein sequences helps scientists study diseases, drug design, and
      biological processes.

      This system allows users to input protein sequences and analyze basic
      properties such as length, molecular weight, and amino acid composition.
